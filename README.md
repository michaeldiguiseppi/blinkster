- You can sort the data by clicking on table headers (sorts are set up specifically to match requirements document, but can be adjusted easily for asc/desc etc)
- Clicking on a row in the table will take you to a details page for that vehicle
- Searching by year, make, model, drivetrain, or mileage will return sorted results
